# OFX Parser

OFX File Parser

**WARNING** - This is still very much in progress.

Once this is stable, I'll update docs and publish as all current OFX parsers for Node are severely lacking.

Requires Node 6.x for harmony support of destructuruing. Will most likely backport compatibility once I've happy with this library.

### Supports Versions

- [x] 1.0.2 specification
- [x] 1.0.3 specification
- [x] 2.0.3 specification
- [x] 2.1.1 specification
